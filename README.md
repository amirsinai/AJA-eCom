## Project Description

AJA-eCommerce is a project created by 3 junior developers, and the website is created to showcase our web-development skills and learning capabilities. The website is developed using react components along with Amazon Web Services. Currently our website is still on development, and once it is ready, you will be able to create an account, add items to your cart, give reviews, and enjoy the website.

Throughout our project, we have challenged ourselves to use components beyond our experiences, this includes; Working with services such AWS, REST-API , serverless functions, creating APIs by linking through Lambda then DynamoDB, styling websites with MUI, Styled, Bootstrap, and many more!

AJA website welcomes user with a season ralated graphical slider and takes users to shopping page when reated button is clicked.

## Development Experience

        -Angelo
 "I had a fun experience creating this project with my groupmates! This is our first time developing a project with Amazon Web Services, and I am proud of what we have done. I am the person who is in charge of the BackEnd; I created the BackEnd by using API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito, all of which are from AWS; I also implemented the functions for our website, that manipulated our API with the help of Axios to update and display our database."
