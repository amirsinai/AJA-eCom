## Project Description

AJA-eCommerce is a project created by 3 junior developers, and the website is created to showcase our web-development skills and learning capabilities. The website is developed using react components along with Amazon Web Services. Currently our website is still on development, and once it is ready, you will be able to create an account, add items to your cart, give reviews, and enjoy the website.

Throughout our project, we have challenged ourselves to use components beyond our experiences, this includes; Working with services such AWS, REST-API , serverless functions, creating APIs by linking through Lambda then DynamoDB, styling websites with MUI, Styled, Bootstrap, and many more!

AJA website welcomes user with a season ralated graphical slider and takes users to shopping page when reated button is clicked.

The shopping page shows products images and title, on hover, product can be added to shopping bag, added to wishlist or looked up for details.

## Development Experience

        -Angelo
 "I had a fun experience creating this project with my groupmates! This is our first time developing a project with Amazon Web Services, and I am proud of what we have done. I am the person who is in charge of the BackEnd; I created the BackEnd by using API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Cognito, all of which are from AWS; I also implemented the functions for our website, that manipulated our API with the help of Axios to update and display our database." 


        -Jonathan"
 "This project was an amazing experience to get for the final project that we will be doing in this bootcamp. In our group we have learned a lot through out the bootcamp and we put what we learned into this. I was in charge for most of the front-end of the website. I was using React Bootstrap, MUI, and I learned a new component being Styled-Components. Styled-Components is a react components which make it to be able to seperatly make the styling for each component that I was doing. In their documentation it states that this also loads the least amount of code for the end users. These were all using different styling and what I enjoy is that you don't have to look through your CSS for the right styling that is used for each componenet. They are all seperate from each other which makes it nice. I barely started learning it but hopefully I can start learning more about it because I truly enjoyed using it."

        -Amir
 "learning to work with AWS is existing, I was in charge of creating and setting up the main github repo and AWS account, added the model tables, contents(products, images, links) and relationship, created the graphical logo AJA (Angelo, Jonathan, Amir) and working on search bar to return products based on keyword or a product name"


## Issues

- Every item have the same reviews.

- Everyone has the same wishlist and you can add as many of the same items in the wishlist.

- Searchbar is not functioning/implemented.

- Subscribe to Newspaper and Footer are nonfunctional(there for design)
